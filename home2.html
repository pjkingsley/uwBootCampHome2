            <p id="aboutMe">Hello and thank you for your interest.  I'm a Washington native living in Seattle.  At the University of Washington I studied history, philosophy, law, literature, and drama.  So naturally I became a server at upscale restaurants.  I spent 10 years in the restaurant industry as a bussboy, server, bartender, wine stewart and general manager.  After ten years, though, I decided to return to school to learn more about wine and enrolled at the Northwest Wine Achadamy, part of South Seattle College.  Course work there included: atomic chemistry, vineyard management, science of food and wine pairing, enology, wines of the world (I & II), sensory and production.  I then started my career as an Enologist and was hired as an assistant winemaker.  This was well and good for three years but then I realized I was living in Seattle, by which I mean I was broke.  To return to financial stability I started working retail wine sales which could provide a steady paycheck, if not a lucrative one.  Which is why I am now here.  Please look over my work and judge for yourself I can be of help to you.  Thanks again!
                Peter
